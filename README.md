FOOD TRIVIA README FILE.
For my Python Fundamentals Project, I decided to create a trivia game and chose “Food
Around the World” as the theme for the game. I chose this because I have a passion for learning
about other cultures and food is one of the main categories I love to learn about. I knew what I
wanted the game to do visually but that proved to be the most difficult challenge for myself.
I started out by writing out all my questions and answers on a word document and then
wrote all my statements I would want printed in my python file. Then I tried to use a dictionary
at first to store all my answers. However, it ended up not working in my favor and I had to come
up with another way to store them. I chose to use the list variable because I can add my
questions and multiple choice answers inside my list without making it too complicated using a
key and variable and then trying to print my questions and answers. I used another file to store
my Class variable because I was having a hard time accessing it on the same file, so I just
imported it to the main .py to access its class and its variables. 

I used two lists, one for my questions and the multiple choice answers; the other to
store the answers. Then I set up my function to run the game. The game starts with a welcome
statement and tells you to press enter to begin the game. Each question will only appear once
the first one has been answered. The trivia will tell you if you got the question right or wrong
and then move on to the next question. This is all inside a ‘for’ loop. The score is calculated by
the number of how many you got right over how many questions there are altogether.
Once there are no more questions, a statement will tell you your score and then thank
you for playing the trivia game. Some things I would like to add to this game is to have a
scoreboard of all who have tried the game and show it to the players at the end of the game. I
would also like to give the players another chance at trying the game out. I learned to
troubleshoot, take breaks in between assignments to clear my head, and use all the resources
given to me to find answers and methods.
